# Project-When-Was-the-Golden-Age-of-Video-Games
In this project, we'll analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. we'll search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and we'll explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

Our search will involve joining datasets and comparing results with set theory. we'll also filter, group, and order data. Make sure we brush up on these skills before trying this project!

The database contains two tables. We've limited each table to 400 rows for this project, but you can find the complete dataset with over 13,000 games on Kaggle.
